# Hive
- residue walls
- floors
- Workbenches? That's a good question. None are shown canon-wise with.. Any intelligence to use devices. I'd most likely say a "no" to that.

# Xenomorph Types
- Runners
- Drones
- Warriors
- Praetorian
- Boilers (Suicide acid-bombers?? Acid-Spitters?)

# Queen / Eggs
- The queen would also have to be stationary, while having an ovipositer..
- anyway, if the queen has an ovipositer then she should just be like an hive, but only producing eggs that i assume the drones can move
- Would the Queen be able to rotate from Stationary to Mobile?
It was a major thing in Alien 2.
- What if she produced a new limb or implant of the ovipositor that reduced movement drastically, and would periodically produce eggs?
- maybe it could be like mounting a mortar, only every "whatever" amount of time they "shoot" an egg in the general vicinity

# Lifecycle (Egg->Facehugger->Host Pawn->Chestburster->Grow into Xenomorph)

- I remember the Borg race mod had a weapon that caused an extreme "disease" that actually assimilated the host of the "disease" into another borg, that would then immedieatly be a "Colonist" pawn.
- risky operation to remove
- If the "disease" reaches 100%, I guess it would spawn the Chestburster Pawn and kill the Host Pawn.
- Maybe you have to reimplant it in something else, like an animal?
- Borg mod also did it, except it would completely remove the original corpse of the host, and spawn the borg colonist in its place.
- Chestburster Could have a hediff comp That makes it spawn a new pawn at a certain severity
Xenomorph types
- Runner-type Xenos come from four-legged animals canon-wise (cows and dogs are most definitely confirmed), but there was also (in games) Rhinoceros Xenomorphs, and in a comic there was one bred from an Alligator or Crocodile.
- "It has also been shown, both on-screen and in the games based on the Alien series, that the Xenomorph's form is affected by its host, so that different species of hosts will create different varieties of Xenomorph" variations

# Acid blood
- maybe have it as a (kinda) structure and if pawns walk over it, they get acidic burns
of course the structure would leave after a short while
think of things like the barbed wire mod
- I get the feeling it wouldn't be too difficult to script in the automated disappearance of the "structure." Looking at the Manto-race mod.

# Xenomorph Enemy Raids?
